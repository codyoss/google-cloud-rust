///
/// # Service Description
///
/// Configures and manages Cloud Memorystore for Redis instances
///
/// Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis v1
///
/// The `redis.googleapis.com` service implements the Google Cloud Memorystore
/// for Redis API and defines the following resource model for managing Redis
/// instances:
///
/// * The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named: `/projects/*`
/// * Each project has a collection of available locations, named: `/locations/*`
/// * Each location has a collection of Redis instances, named: `/instances/*`
/// * As such, Redis instances are resources of the form:
///   `/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
///
/// Note that location_id must be referring to a GCP `region`; for example:
///
/// * `projects/redpepper-1290/locations/us-central1/instances/my-redis`
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `CloudRedis` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `CloudRedis` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `CloudRedis` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
